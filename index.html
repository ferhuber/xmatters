            I always believed that working as a team made us stronger than working in separate silos. In my work experience so far, I got great results through an incredible teamwork. Also, having a personalized service based on customer needs is essential to stand out nowadays, that there are so many premade templates and quick alternatives to having a website.
That's why I'm very excited and interested in working with you.

              Recently, I worked on a project for a Vancouver product start-up called Robot Tools (robboxtools.com) in a partnership with Elevator Ventures.
              In the project, I was responsible for developing the website according to the provided layout. I’ve used WordPress, HTML/CSS, and PHP(customization) to develop the website theme. I’ve also made a MailChimp API integration for newsletter subscription, and a customized contact form to integrate with the mail server according to customer needs.
              Furthermore, the project was on a tight schedule of one week to coincide with the client’s product launch, and it was successfully delivered due to careful organization and planning.

              Also, I worked in a small team with 5 people over a weekend to build an application for testing users’ coding skills. The application was built using Rails, JavaScript and Bootstrap. Individually, I also built an e-commerce application to help local bakeries accept customized orders using Rails, JavaScript, AJAX, API’s and PostgreSQL. For this project, I learned many new skills such as handling complex database associations and rendering the data using AJAX requests in Rails.
